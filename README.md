# Budge

Budge takes the users income and allows the them to select weekly, monthly, or yearly options, in order to allocate their money according to their personal expenses. After the budget is created, if there is money left over, the user will be prompted on if they would like to “budge” their money, meaning they can add the remaining value, however they choose, back into the budget they created.
